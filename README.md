#Welcome to the Lyric Police!
##The official, un-official list of things bands aren't allowed to write about anymore

If you're a metal/hardcore fan, the number of lyrics that you've heard repeated record after record rivals only that of the number of times that the breakdown at the end of Domination has been ripped off. You know exactly what I'm talking about - things like getting stabbed in the back, fighting against the world, and my personal favourite, rhyming "strife" with "life". It's time we let these bands know: we really don't need to beat these dead horses anymore

###This is also my first time playing around with Firebase
Firebase is a cloud-based database, semi-recently acquired by Google, and provides a lot of really interesting opportunities for playing around with small applications. Learn more here - firebase.io
